# Lindenmayer Playground

Inspired by the [Mandelbrot playground](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=26) released by the Swift development team, this playground features [Lindenmayer systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system), better known as L-Systems.

According to Wikipedia, *An L-system or Lindenmayer system is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar.* In this playground you can try out rendering various predefined systems or define your own. The Lindenmayer struct used to define a rule set allows for the basic operators, drawing, moving, turning and grouping.

For more information, look at the sources attached to the main playground. 
All examples of systems come from Wikipedia.
